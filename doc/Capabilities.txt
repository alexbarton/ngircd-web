This document lists and describes the "IRC capabilities" that ngIRCd supports
and can be requested by a IRC/IRCv3 client that supports the "CAP" command.

ngIRCd implements the "IRC Client Capabilities Extension" as described here:

I. Supported Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None. At the moment, ngIRCd supports the "CAP" command and its sub-commands
but offers no capabilities that could be requested by a client.
