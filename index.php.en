	ngIRCd
</h2>
<p>
	ngIRCd is a free open source server for Internet Relay Chat (IRC),
	which is being developed under the GNU General Public License
	(<a href="doc/COPYING" hreflang="en">GPL</a>).
	It has been written from scratch and is consequently, unlike most
	other IRC daemons, not based on the originator, the daemon of the
	IRCNet.
</p>
<p>
	The name <em>ngIRCd</em> means <em>next generation IRC daemon</em>,
	which is a little bit exaggerated: <em>lightweight Internet Relay Chat
	server</em> most probably would be a better name :-)
</p>
<p class="hint">
	<em>Hint:</em>
	at freshmeat.net there's an
	<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ngircd/">entry</a>
	for the ngIRCd project. You can inform about new releases and get
	update notifications via E-Mail.

	<a href="index.php.de">deutsche</a> Version.

<h2>
	Simplicity
</h2>
<p>
	ngIRCd supports
	<a href="doc/Platforms.txt">a whole range</a>
	of platforms: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, but
	ngIRCD also runs on Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and other Unices.
</p>
<p>
	After the installation of ngIRC, which is executed via packet
	installation or configure-make-make-install, and once you have edited
	the ngircd.conf, you can get started after 5 minutes.&nbsp;â€“ only a
	few lines need adapting, the rest is purely optional.
