	ngIRCd
</h2>
<p>
	ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat server
	for small or private networks, developed under the GNU General Public
	License
	(<a href="doc/COPYING" hreflang="en">GPL</a>).
	It is easy to configure, can cope with dynamic IP addresses, and
	supports IPv6, SSL-protected connections as well as PAM for
	authentication. It is written from scratch and not based on the
	original IRCd.
</p>
<p>
	The name <em>ngIRCd</em> means <em>next generation IRC daemon</em>,
	which is a little bit exaggerated: <em>lightweight Internet Relay Chat
	server</em> most probably would have been a better name :-)
</p>
<p class="hint">
	<em>Hint:</em>
	at Freecode there's an
	<a href="http://freecode.com/projects/ngircd">entry</a>
	for the ngIRCd project. You can inform about new releases and get
	update notifications via E-Mail.

<h2>
	Simplicity
</h2>
<p>
	ngIRCd supports
	<a href="doc/Platforms.txt">a whole range</a>
	of platforms: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, but
	ngIRCd also runs on Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and other Unices.
</p>
<p>
	After the installation of ngIRCd, which is executed via packet
	installation or configure-make-make-install, and once you have edited
	the ngircd.conf, you can get started after 5 minutes&nbsp;â€“ only a
	few lines need adapting, the rest is purely optional.
